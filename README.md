# _Down to Earth_ Article Figure

This repository contains the Python code used to generate Figure 2 in the _Down to Earth_ daily Physics Today article I wrote.

The article, "Satellites: Invaluable eyes in the sky" can be accessed [here](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/10.1063/PT.5.4026) and is referenced as [doi: 10.1063/PT.5.4026](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/PT.5.4026).

## Requirements

To generate the figure, a Python installation is required as are the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) Python modules.
